    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Crêpe bretonne is a traditional dish in Lower Brittany. Having become well known throughout France and in other countries, the crêpe is also served in crêperies outside Brittany. It may be eaten plain, or filled with diverse ingredients; salty or sweet, according to the base recipe. The Crêpe bretonne can be made of wheat (sweet crepe) or buckwheat (salted crepe). This last is less well-known and should not be confused with the buckwheat pancake typical of Upper Brittany, which has a different recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
